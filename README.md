This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Roadmap

Here are some planned features and ideas for future development:

- **UI Improvements**
  - Further tidy up and polish the user interface for a more intuitive and visually appealing experience.

- **Multi-User Decisions**
  - Allow multiple users to collaborate on the same decision, share factors, outcomes, and ratings.

- **Automatic Review Lookup / Web Scraping**
  - Integrate web scraping or API-based review lookup to automatically gather relevant information for decisions (e.g., product reviews, destination info).

- **AI-Assisted Decision Overview**
  - Use AI to analyze decision data and provide smart suggestions, summaries, or highlight potential biases.

- **Export & Share**
  - Allow users to export their decision summary as PDF or share a link with others for feedback.

- **Comments & Discussion**
  - Add a comment section for each decision so users (or collaborators) can discuss and provide input.

- **Reminders & Follow-ups**
  - Let users set reminders to revisit decisions or follow up on outcomes after a certain period.

- **Mobile App / PWA Support**
  - Make the app installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline and mobile use.

- **Custom Factor/Outcome Types**
  - Allow users to add descriptions, images, or links to factors and outcomes for richer context.

- **Decision Confidence Meter**
  - After rating, show a “confidence” score based on how balanced or lopsided the ratings are.

- **Integration with Calendar/Tasks**
  - Add decisions or follow-ups to Google Calendar, Outlook, or task management tools.

- **Anonymous/Public Decisions**
  - Allow users to make some decisions public for community input or to browse public decisions for inspiration.

- **Accessibility Enhancements**
  - Ensure the app is fully accessible (screen reader support, keyboard navigation, color contrast, etc.).
